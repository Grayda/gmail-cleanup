# Privacy Policy

This open-source script is designed to help users manage their Gmail inbox by identifying and archiving or deleting emails based on a list of user-defined labels and timeframes (e.g., `Netflix/New Shows`, `14d` to clear out all Netflix "New Shows" emails after 14 days).

## Data Handling
This script uses Google's Gmail API to interact with your account and does *not* share or store any data with any third parties outside of Google.

## Transparency
This script is fully open-source, and users are encouraged to inspect the source code to verify how it works. You are in full control of how, when, and where the script runs.
