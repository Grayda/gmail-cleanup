# Privacy Policy

This open-source script is designed to help users manage their Gmail inbox by identifying and archiving or deleting emails based on a list of user-defined labels and timeframes (e.g., `Netflix/New Shows`, `14d` to clear out all Netflix "New Shows" emails after 14 days).

## Data Handling
Local Execution Only: All processing takes place entirely on the machine where the script is run. No data is transmitted to any third parties.

Google Access: The script uses Google's Gmail API to interact with your account. As such, your data is shared only with Google in accordance with their terms and APIs.

No Third-Party Servers: This script does not send or receive data to or from any server other than Google.

## Transparency
This script is fully open-source, and users are encouraged to inspect the source code to verify how it works. You are in full control of how, when, and where the script runs.
